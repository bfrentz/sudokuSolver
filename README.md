# Sudoku Solver 

This is a sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm.

___

Future update ideas:
* ~~Create a gui which allows the user to play interactively (I was thinking that a terminal version would be good, but it just wasn't fun to look at the board)~~
* Within game gui, allow for immediate solve / show the solution more cleanly
* ~~Connect to some api to get starting sudoku boards~~
* Allow user to input sudoku from file or clipboard
